# zkp-rangeproof-age-verification

This is a fork of https://github.com/ing-bank/zkproofs that just contains a little example on using `com.ing.blockchain.zk` to do age verification. This is just initial exploratory work to check out the API of this library. We kinda like its simplicity!

#### check out [ZKRPSample.java](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/zkp-rangeproof-age-verification/blob/master/examples/java/zkrp/src/main/java/ZKRPSample.java)
