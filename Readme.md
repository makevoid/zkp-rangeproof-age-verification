# zkp-rangeproof-age-verification

This is a fork of https://github.com/ing-bank/zkproofs that just contains a little example on using `com.ing.blockchain.zk` to do age verification. This is just initial exploratory work to check out the API of this library. We kinda like its simplicity!

#### check out [ZKRPSample.java](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/zkp-rangeproof-age-verification/blob/master/examples/java/zkrp/src/main/java/ZKRPSample.java)

Please see the up to date project and the original readme on the main repository origin. 

### TODO:

- document setting up and running the project with intellij
- make a video of the demo
